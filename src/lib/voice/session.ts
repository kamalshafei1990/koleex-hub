   lib/voice/session — the browser side of a realtime voice call.

   Phase 15 step 2. Deliberately NOT a React component: the connection is a
   state machine with a teardown obligation, and that is the part worth
   testing. A component that owned it would put the logic somewhere no
   assertion can reach — the same reason latencyStats() left its route.

   NOTHING IN THE PRODUCT RENDERS THIS YET. It is wired to no screen. A voice
   button appears when the call works end to end, not before.

   WHAT IT KNOWS ABOUT THE VENDOR: nothing. It posts an offer to our own route
   and applies the answer that comes back. It never learns an endpoint, a model
   id, a region or a key, and there is no field it could read them from. That
   is the whole point of brokering the handshake server-side, and it is
   asserted rather than assumed.

   EVERY DEPENDENCY IS INJECTED — the peer connection, the microphone, fetch.
   Not for purity: WebRTC does not exist in Node, so injection is the only way
   this logic gets tested at all rather than being verified by reading it.

   THE MICROPHONE IS THE SAFETY-CRITICAL PART. Every exit path — success,
   failure, refusal, timeout, caller stop — must stop the captured tracks. A
   voice feature that leaves the mic live after an error is a privacy defect,
   not a bug in a feature nobody is using yet, and it is the one thing here
   that can hurt someone.
