/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   POST /api/ai/chat — now powered by the hybrid router.

   Step 5: this route delegates to routeAi() instead of calling Groq
   directly. Classification happens server-side:
     · chat     → Groq
     · business → DeepSeek  (gated behind USE_DEEPSEEK + DEEPSEEK_API_KEY)
     · unknown  → Groq      (fallback per router spec)

   Response contract is unchanged: { reply, provider }. Callers continue
   to read `reply`; we translate the router's stable ProviderName
   ("groq" | "deepseek") into that field. The only previously-visible
   detail we drop is the ":model-id" suffix on the provider string —
   no caller in the app uses it, and keeping it out of the public
   contract keeps the future free to swap models without a UI change.

   /api/ai/agent is untouched by this change. Its orchestrator remains
   the authoritative agent path with its own tool-loop behaviour.
